## Constellation

A constellation is a representation of an interface as a coordinate system of elements and position relative to the top left corner. For example, a constellation of width 100 and height 200 will have (100, 0) as the top right, (0, 200) at the bottom left and (100, 200) at the bottom right.

## Purpose

By converting interfaces from xml-like representations to positions in space, we can denote actions with coordinate precision instead of seraching for element by xpath.
